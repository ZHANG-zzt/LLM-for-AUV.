We introduced LLM to realize the human-robot interaction system with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV)

# Main Features
Our work is to establish a ROS2-based AUV interactive system. By leveraging LLM's understanding of human instructions, we provide high-level decisions to the low-level controllers, thereby reducing the complexity of sea trials.
